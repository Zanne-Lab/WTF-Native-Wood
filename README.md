# WTF-Native-Wood
Contains the data and analyses associated with the manuscript on decay of native wood stems for the Australia Wood Termites Fungi project.

These data and analyses are currently unpublished, so please contact Amy Zanne or Steven Allison if you plan to use them.

Process_data.R retrieves raw data files from Google Drive folders and tidies them for public use and analysis. This script is not intended for public use and will likely not work because the raw files are not publicly available.

Analyze_data.R uses the tidy raw data files for statistical analysis and graphics generation.
